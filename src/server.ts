const INSTRUCTIONS = `agent-locks: filesystem-based work-claiming locks shared across every git worktree of the current repository. No database — everything lives as markdown files under the repo's shared .git directory, so it is automatically invisible to git and never gets committed.

Recommended workflow, in order:
1. Before starting work on a set of files, call lock_query (default view, active locks only) to see what other agents are already doing, and call lock_check_conflict with the globs you're about to touch to see if anyone's active lock overlaps them. lock_check_conflict is purely informational — it never blocks you, it just gives you information to make your own judgment call with.
2. If you decide to proceed, call lock_create to claim the work: give it a title, the glob patterns describing what you're touching, and a checklist of the tasks you plan to do.
3. As you actually complete each task, call lock_update immediately — not batched at the end. The whole point of this system is that other agents can see live, current state; a lock that only gets updated right before you finish is not useful to anyone watching in the meantime.
4. When the work is done, call lock_finish with a short summary. This moves the lock out of the active set and into the done archive, and it will no longer show up in lock_query's default view.

Honesty note on agent identity: this server cannot detect your agent id or your parent agent's id automatically — no MCP transport mechanism exposes that. Pass agent_id/parent_agent_id to lock_create only if you already know them from your own context (e.g. an orchestration harness gave you an explicit id); otherwise omit them and they will be recorded as null. Do not guess or fabricate an id.`;
